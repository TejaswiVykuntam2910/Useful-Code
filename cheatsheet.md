### Intro(week1) ###
#### Intro ####
> #### What is software?  
>  
> Defines a set of computations  
> Useful only in presence of human activity  
  

> #### What is Engineering?  
> use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items  
  

> #### What is Software Engineering?
> A systematic study of Methodology, Techniques, and Tools to build high quality software that is correct and is built in given time and budget.
#### Software Process ####
> #### What is software process:
> #### Software process helps break the task into several parts that are  
> - Systematic  
> - Formal  
> Examples: Waterfall, Evolutionary, Unified Software Processs and Agile methodology.
#### Software Phases ####
Processes are characterised by phases.
> ### Software Phases:
> 1. Requirements/System Engineering
> 2. Design
> 3. Implementation
> 4. Verification and Validation
> 5. Maintenance
#### SLDC Models ####
> ### Managing Software complexity through Software Development Life Cycle(SLDC) Models
> - Waterfall Model
> - Spiral Model
> - Evolutionary Prototyping
> - Rational Unified Process
> - Agile Methodology  

> ### SDLC steps: Design
> Breakdown requirements to internal components  
>> - Architecture  
>> - UI  
>> - Component  
>> - DS Algo  

> ### SDLC steps: Coding
> Translate design to software  
> Keep a tab on  
>> - Complexity  
>> - Diversity  
>> - Validation  
>> - Standards  

> ### SDLC steps: Verification and Validation  
> - Have we built the right software? - Validation  
> - Have we built the software right? - Verification  
> Done at:  
>> unit, integration, system levels  

> ### SDLC steps: Maintenance
> Deals with issues in the delivered software
>> - Corrective: Bug fixes
>> - Perfective: Enhancements
>> - Adaptive: Environment changes
#### Waterfall Model ####
> Go from one phase to another like a cascading waterfall  
> Software Concept->Requirement Analysis->Architectural design Detailed design-> Coding and debugging->System testing  
> This is a very old process  
> Pros:  
>> - Find errors easily  

> Cons:
>> - Not flexible
#### Spiral Model ####
> Incremental Risk-Oriented Model
>> - Determine Objectives
>> - Identify and Resolve Risks
>> - Develop and test software
>> - Plan next iteration  

> Iterate over.  
> Pros:
>> Risk reduction, Easy to Enhance, Software developed early  

> Cons:
>>  Complex, Dependent on Risk Analysis, Requires Specific Expertise
#### Evolutionary Prototyping ####
> Evolve an initial prototype based on customer feedback  
>> - Start with an initial prototype
>> - Design and implement the prototype
>> - Refine until acceptable
>> - Complete and release  

> Pros:
>> Immediate feedback, helps understand requirements  

> Cons:
>> Difficult to Plan, Can Deteriorate to Code-and-fix
#### Rational Unified Process ####
> Use Unified Modeling Language(UML) to formally capture the order and duration of different activities.  
>> - Inception
>> - Elaboration
>> - Construction
>> - Transition
#### Agile Process ####
> Be more flexible (trading off discipline) in accommodating changes in requirements.  
>> Fail, Pass, Refactor
#### Choosing a model ####
> - Requirements understanding
> - Expected lifetime
> - Risk
> - Schedule Constraints
> - Customer Interaction
> - Expertise
### Week2 ###
#### Requirements Engineering ####
> Establish stakeholdersâ€™ needs that are to be satisfied by the software.  
> Why important?
>> - Cost of error correction grows exponentially in maintenance  

> How to get it right?
>> - Elicit  
>> - Analyze
>> - Specify
>> - Validate
>> - Manage  
>> - Iterate
